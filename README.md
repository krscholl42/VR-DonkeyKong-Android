# VR-DonkeyKong-Android

Introduction
Welcome to the Github page for VR Donkey Kong, a Boilermake V Hackathon project created by Anthony Niemic, Jay Rixie, and Kaitlyn Scholl. The original goal of this project was to created a Virtual Reality level of Donkey Kong (1981) and network with a phone to allow another player to act as Donkey Kong.

Challenges
Unfortunately, Unreal Engine did not allow for easy external communication, and because of this, the project is currently separated as an app and game.
